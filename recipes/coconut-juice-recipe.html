    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Are you feeling thirsty? Are you feeling like coconut water? Lets just wait and jazz it up.I bring you a 1 minute recipe that will turn your coconut water into tender coconut juice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Coconut water</li>
        <li>¼ cup Tender coconut (Soft Malai)</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pierce a hole in the coconut and remove the water in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Using a spoon or a scooper remove the tender coconut (cream) from the inside of the coconut. (Always ask the coconut seller to give you a coconut with very tender cream inside, due to their experience they will be able to give you the right one).</li>
        <li>Take the coconut water, the tender coconut and the sugar, and put it in a Blender.</li>
        <li>Blend till the tender coconut is fully blended in with the coconut water. This hardly takes time.</li>
        <li>Pour the Tender Coconut Juice in a bowl and freeze it for 10 minutes. This juice tastes even better when it’s served cold.</li>
        <li>Now pour it into a serving glass and serve chilled.</li>
